\section{Fibonacci Twists}
For Fibonacci anyons, the twist factor is $\theta _{\tau } =\mathrm{e}^{\pm 4\pi \mathrm{i} /5}$ (With \textbackslash pm being for right or left-handed theories respectively). Check that these twist factors agree with the $R$-matrices (Eq. 10.2) and Eq. 15.2 and Eq. 15.3.
